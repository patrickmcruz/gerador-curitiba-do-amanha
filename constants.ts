    // description: "Scenario where everything was planned. meticulously maintain the existing geography, if it is high and mountainous terrain, stay elevated, slopes, core building structures, and overall street layout. Transform the urban environment into a modern, meticulously planned, and well-structured residential neighborhood. The architecture should reflect clean, contemporary lines, integrated with lush urban forestry and strategically placed trees within the existing landscape. Overlay the current street network with wide, impeccably paved streets featuring clear markings and dedicated lanes. If a river or waterway is present, it should be transformed into a beautiful, crystal-clear channel, replacing any former open sewers. Ensure all infrastructure (sewage, rainwater drainage, utilities) is subtle, high-standard, and concealed. The entire area must be spotless, devoid of any visible trash or debris. Integrate seamless access to public transport, with well-designed stops or stations appearing naturally within the scene. Daytime, clear sky, inviting atmosphere, photorealistic, depicting the original location under these pristine and planned conditions."

    // description: "Scenario where city was not planned. Meticulously maintain the existing geography, slopes, buildings structures, and overall street layout. Transform the urban elements into an unplanned informal settlement. The scene should depict a lack of city planning. The sky above the location is harsh and overcast. Integrate densely packed, makeshift additions and alterations to existing dwellings, constructed from various scrap materials, giving them a haphazard appearance. Overlay the existing paths and streets with unpaved dirt, mud, and debris. Where present, allow open, overflowing sewage to run visibly through makeshift channels. Prominently add visible, exposed electrical wires crisscrossing precariously between structures and power poles. The ground should be visibly littered with scattered piles of uncollected trash and debris. Show sparse, struggling vegetation rather than lush greenery. The area should reflect an absence of structured public transport infrastructure. Overcast daylight, gritty, realistic, documentary style, depicting the original location under these conditions."
